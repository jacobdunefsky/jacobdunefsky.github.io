	<h2>About me.</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>My name is Jacob Dunefsky. Welcome to my homepage! I am currently an undergraduate at Yale University pursuing a combined B.S./M.S. degree in computer science. I've been programming in some capacity for over a decade now, and over the course of that time, I've really come to enjoy it.</p>
	<p>Over the course of this journey, I've come into possession of a fair amount of technical skills, even though there is always more to learn. I've gotten my hands dirty with OS development, web dev, audio synthesis, machine learning, mobile app development, networks development, and quite a bit else.</p>
	<p>In addition to programming itself, I've done a hefty amount of proof-based math, including real analysis, linear algebra, and abstract algebra. I've found that this background often comes in necessary when keeping up with state-of-the-art work in many fields of computer science.</p>
	<p>Of course, I also have interests beyond these technical matters: I enjoy language-learning, writing music, and exercising. But for now, we'll put those subjects aside.</p>

	<h2>About this site.</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>This website is intended to provide you, dear reader, with more information about myself (in my capacity as a programmer, researcher, and student) than can be gained from a mere curriculum vitae or the like.</p>
	<p>As such, if you're interested in learning more, you are invited to <b>click the links</b> in the header and <b>explore</b>.</p>
